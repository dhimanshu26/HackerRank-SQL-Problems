# Problem Statement
Consider P1(a, c) and P2(b, d) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a, b) are the respective minimum and (c, d) maximum values of  _Northern Latitude_  (_LAT_N_) and  are the respective minimum and maximum values of  _Western Longitude_  (_LONG_W_) in  **STATION**.

Query the  [Euclidean Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)  between points  and  and  _format your answer_  to display  decimal digits.

**Input Format**

The  **STATION**  table is described as follows:

where  _LAT_N_  is the northern latitude and  _LONG_W_  is the western longitude.
